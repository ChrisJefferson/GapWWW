  Loading ZOO Files
</H2>

<H3>
  Browser Problems
</H3>
Some browsers have problems with downloading the `zoo' archive files in that
they load it as ASCII text. Saving this text would produce a corrupt
archive.

<P>
In some browsers you can use the right mouse button (or Shift-Button) to
save links directly to a file. (Menu point `Save as'.)

<P>
If this is not possible, you will have to add a MIMEtype for ZOO files.

<P>
For example in netscape under Linux you have to select Edit -> Preferences
-> Navigator -> Applications. You will get a window like this:

<P>
<IMG SRC="netsc-pref.gif" ALT="Netscape Applications Menu">

<P>
Select New. You get another window in which you specify that ``zoo'' files
are to be saved to disk:

<P>
<IMG SRC="netsc-zoo.gif" ALT="Zoo Mimetype Menu">

<P>
Close both windows with OK. Now loading the files should work.

<H3>
  Extraction Problems
</H3>
The ZOO files we are using are in an extended format that permits to
distinguish ASCII and binary files. If you do not use the `unzoo' utility
provided by us you might end up extracting the files all in binary format.
(This might cause some problems under non-UNIX operating systems.)
