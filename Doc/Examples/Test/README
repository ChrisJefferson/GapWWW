            Testing the examples under a new GAP version
            --------------------------------------------

This Test directory containes some simple tcsh scripts which can be
used to check if the given examples are still valid under a new GAP
version.

For each of the current examples there is an own script of the form

   run.example

These scripts assume that the intended GAP version can be called by
just saying 'gap'. If not, you have to change the respective call in
the scripts appropriately.

Let us consider the example 'co3' to describe how the test files work:
To check this example you have just to call the script

    run.co3

It extracts the GAP input and output from the associated mixer file
'../co3.mixer', starts a new GAP job, produces four files

    in      input file as extracted from the mixer file
    out     output file as extracted from the mixer file
    erg     output file of the new GAP job ('erg' stands for 'Ergebnis')
    dif     differences between the files out and erg

and compares them with the respective given files

    ../co3.in
    co3.out
    co3.erg
    co3.dif

The new files should coincide with the old ones except of output lines
containing computing times, although the file 'dif' itself may be very
long.

Note that in the case of the example 'cavicchioli' you will be asked
if you want to continue a certain coset enumeration with a new limit
of 512000 cosets. You will have to react by typing

    quit;

After running the tests you may remove the files 'in', 'out', 'erg',
and 'dif'.
