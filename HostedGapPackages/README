"HostedGapPackages" is the directory to publish packages which are 
temporary maintained by us (for example, is the author is no longer
maintaining the package, and a small adjustment of the package is 
needed, which may not require finding a new maintainer).

The content of this directory is a not a part of the GAP website which
is kept under the CVS control, but just an additional section stored
separately and made available at www.gap-system.org/HostedGapPackages/... 
via an alias at httpd.conf. Please do not commit anything else in this
directory.
