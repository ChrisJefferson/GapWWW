         Installation instructions for draft of new web site
        =====================================================


==========================
 Purpose of this document
==========================

This document briefly describes, how to install the pages in the WWW2
directory of the St. Andrews GAP CVS repository.


=====================
 Needed ingredients:
=====================

  * Standard tools: cvs, tar, gzip, make, sh
  * A C-compiler, preferably gcc
  * Python version 2.2 or later (for running the mixer)
  * xfig, fig2dev if you want to edit the sitemap
  * a web server if pages shall be published
  * a copy of the full doc directory from a GAP installation for references
    into the manual (this can reside on some web site)
  * facility to run CGI-scripts for feedback pages
  * setup for automatic creation of the pages for packages

 
=========================
 Installation procedure:
=========================

(1) Checkout the WWW2 directory tree from CVS:

    cvs -d :pserver:gap@cvs-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk:/gap/CVS checkout WWW2

    This creates a subdirectory WWW2, containing the whole site.

(2) Checkout and install the mixer:

    cvs -d :pserver:gap@cvs-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk:/gap/CVS checkout Mixer
    cd Mixer
    make
    cd ..

(3) Unpack some (frozen) subtrees, which are in archives:

    cd WWW2
    gzip -dc ForumArchive.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd Gap3
    gzip -dc Manual3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd ..

(4) Edit WWW2/lib/config (see that file for instructions)

    vi lib/config

    In this file a few variables have to be defined to adapt the web pages
    to the local conditions.

(5) Copy a whole doc directory of a GAP distribution to the place 
    mentioned in WWW2/lib/config (see step (4)) in the variable
    GAPManualLink (this is WWW2/Manuals in the current setup).

(6) The files for the GAP bibliography have been included into this
    tree in the CVS.

    Create the html and PDF versions by:
    
    cd Doc/Bib
    gap4 convbib.g
    cd ../..
    
    Some notes: 
      - The files reside in Doc/Bib
      - Information about the setup is in Doc/Bib/INFO

(7) Create a link WWW2/index.html -> gap.html to hide directory.

(8) Install search facility:

    Things are in WWW2/Search. You need the "swish" utility installed to
    create the index files for searching. Create a link in the "Search"
    directory to the swish executable.

    Create index files by:

    cd Search
    ln -s PATHTOSWISH swish
    make
    cd ..

    (PATHTOSWISH has to be replaced by the path to the swish executable.)

    The cgi script WWW2/Search/search.cgi will take care of the rest.

(9) Install package manuals:

    Copy the result of Frank's scripts to the place mentioned in 
    WWW2/lib/config (in the variable pkgmixerpath).
    (currently, this is WWW2/Manuals, copy the whole "pkg" directory)

    To update package pages, copy .mixer files and "pkgconf.py" to
    WWW2/Packages.
    
(10) Make sure that a current file is in 
       lib/AllLinksOfAllHelpSections.data
     (this has to be done whenever the released manuals change).

     In dev-version there is a file dev/LinksOfAllHelpSections.g
     Read with new GAP version with current packages installed,
     and call 'WriteAllLinksOfAllHelpSections()', this writes
     the file 'AllLinksOfAllHelpSections.data'.

(11) Run the mixer:

    ../Mixer/mixer.py -f

    (the -f forces creation regardless of timestamps)


==============================
 Installing updated versions:
==============================

If things are changed in CVS, all that has to be done to update the
pages locally is:

  cvs update

in the WWW2 directory, followed by a

  ../Mixer/mixer.py

The mixer has an option "-f" to force recreation of all pages. This is
necessary if some general files like the address database lib/addresses
or templates changes.

To change the sitemap, use xfig to change "sitemap.fig", then run
"makesitemap.sh" (which uses "fig2dev" and Python), then rerun
the mixer ("../Mixer/mixer.py"), possibly with "-f" to force new 
generation of pages.

In the future, Frank's setup for the automatic generation of package
pages has to be integrated with this setup.
