<mixertitle><mixer var="GAP"/> Installation Instructions</mixertitle>

<p>
To obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only
to compile the core system, but also some of its packages. 
</p>

<p>You might want to consider one of the alternative installation 
methods described <a href="index.html#alternatives">here</a> which achieve this 
for you automatically.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, please follow the installation instructions for the traditional 
<mixer var="GAP"/> distribution on UNIX (which includes the popular 
variant Linux), on Apple computers under Mac OS X, and on Windows. These
instructions are contained in the <a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file, 
which may also be found in the <mixer var="GAP"/> root directory after 
unpacking the archive with the <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution.
</p>

<p>
You may find useful the shell script 
<a href="InstPackages.sh"><code>InstPackages.sh</code></a> 
which builds most of the packages that require compilation on UNIX
systems with sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools available
(for 32-bit builds on 64-bit machines, use 
<a href="InstPackages32.sh"><code>InstPackages32.sh</code></a> instead).
You may just try to run the script or to cut and paste it line by line. 
If something doesn't work on your system, please, refer to the 
<code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Optional:</strong>
<mixer var="GAP"/> starts up much faster using a so called <i>workspace</i>.
A workspace can be generated and used as shown in 
the script <a href="CreateWorkspace.sh"><code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the scripts <code>InstPackages.sh</code> and 
<code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code> may require a
<code>chmod&nbsp;+x&nbsp;InstPackages.sh</code> and 
<code>chmod&nbsp;+x&nbsp;CreateWorkspace.sh</code> respectively.
