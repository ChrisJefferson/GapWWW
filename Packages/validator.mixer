<mixertitle>Online Validator for <code>PackageInfo.g</code> File</mixertitle>

<p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> packages must  contain a file
<code>PackageInfo.g</code> in which meta-information is collected:
package name, version, authors/maintainers with contact addresses, location
of download archive(s), infos on provided manuals, ... 
This is used for loading a package into <mixer var="GAP"/> and for a possible
redistribution of a package via the <mixer var="GAP"/> web and ftp sites.
</p> 
<p>See 
<a href="PackageInfo.g">this template file</a> for more details and if you
want to create such a file for your package.
</p>
<p>
One basic check for such a file is provided by the command 
<code>ValidatePackageInfo(filename);</code> from within <mixer var="GAP"/> (at
least 4.4).
</p>
<p>
As further test you can type the URL of a <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file
into this form.
The file is then downloaded and several checks are applied to it. This
should point out to you some common mistakes and hopefully give useful hints
for possible improvements.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this cannot be perfect. 
There may be errors not detected by the script, and it may happen that the
script  complains about points you are actually satisfied with.
</p>
<form action="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/tmp/Packages/checkval" method="post">
<p>
URL of your <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file:<br />
   <input type="text" size="60" maxlength="100" name="url" value=""/>
   <button type="submit">Check/Validate</button>
</p>
<p>
Please, be patient, several programs have to be started for the check, and
files must be downloaded, this can take a little time.
