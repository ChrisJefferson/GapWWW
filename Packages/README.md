# PLEASE DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

All `Packages/*` files are generated automatically from the information
given in PackageInfo.g files of packages included in the latest official
release of GAP. 

Please do not edit them, since any changes will be overwritten after
the next GAP release.

NB: this does not refer to `Packages/Authors/*` and `Packages/Contrib/*`
subdirectories.
