"DevelopersPages" is the directory to keep pages of GAP developers 
asking us to host them (for example, when moving from one institution
to another), in particular, to be able to make available new versions 
of their packages. 

The content of this directory is a not a part of the GAP website which
is kept under the CVS control, but just an additional section stored
separately and made available at www.gap-system.org/DevelopersPages/... 
via an alias at httpd.conf. Please do not commit anything else in this
directory.
